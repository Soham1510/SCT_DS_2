# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction — EDA & Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project is part of my **internship with Skills Craft Technology** and represents **Task 2** of the program.  

The project analyzes the **Titanic dataset** to explore patterns in passenger survival using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and applies a **Machine Learning model** to predict survival chances.  

Key steps covered:
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature engineering
- Model training & evaluation

📊 Dataset

The dataset used is the Titanic dataset (Kaggle / open-source).
It contains details of passengers such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, family size, and survival status.

Target variable: Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

Features used: Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare, Embarked

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution of Age, Fare, and Survival

Impact of Class & Gender on survival

Family size vs survival rate

🤖 Machine Learning

Preprocessing: Missing value handling, encoding categorical features

Models Tested: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)

Jupyter Notebook
